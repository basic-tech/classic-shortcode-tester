A post editor tool for displaying the HTML generated by WordPress shortcodes.

== Description ==
The Shortcode Tester is a post editor tool for WordPress developers that displays in a popup window the HTML generated by WordPress shortcodes,
i.e. so you can quickly view the generated HTML without having to view the entire post.
Please visit [https://github.com/magenta-cuda/shortcode-tester/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/magenta-cuda/shortcode-tester/blob/master/README.md) for a very quick introduction.
**This plugin requires at least PHP 5.4.**

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin from the WordPress repository.
2. Open the 'Plugins' menu item and activate the plugin.
3. Read the tutorial at [https://github.com/magenta-cuda/shortcode-tester/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/magenta-cuda/shortcode-tester/blob/master/README.md).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Error: Permalink not found. Please report this to the developer. =
"The Shortcode Tester" uses permalinks. In particular, it will not work with posts or pages in "Draft" status.

= "Show Rendered" shows more than the shortcode HTML elements.
"The Shortcode Tester" tries to hide HTML elements that are not part of the shortcode. It assumes that the current theme uses the standard WordPress framework for emitting the header, the content, sidebars and the footer ( actions/filters such as 'the_content', 'get_sidebar', 'get_footer', ... ). If the current theme deviates from this framework "The Shortcode Tester" will not be able to properly identify the header, sidebars and/or the footer.
