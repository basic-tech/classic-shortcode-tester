The shortcode tester is a very simple post content editor tool for WordPress developers for displaying the HTML generated from WordPress shortcodes in a popup window. To display the shortcode tester from the post editor page click on the Shortcode Tester button in the editorâ€™s toolbar at the top of the page. ( It should be to the immediate right of the Block Navigation button. ) Enter the shortcode into the left pane. ( \[ gallery \] in this example. ) Click on the Evaluate button. The HTML generated by the shortcode will be displayed in the right pane. Of course the shortcode is evaluated in the context of the current post in the editor. The other buttons lets you hide one of the panes to give you a larger view of the other pane.
