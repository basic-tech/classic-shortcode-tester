The shortcode tester is a very simple post content editor tool for displaying the HTML generated from WordPress shortcodes in a popup window. To display the shortcode tester from the post editor page click on the Shortcode Tester button in the editorâ€™s toolbar at the top of the page. (It should be to the immediate right of the Block Navigation button.) Enter the shortcode into the left pane. (\[ gallery \] in this example.) Click on the Evaluate button. The HTML generated by the shortcode will be displayed in the right pane. Of course the shortcode is evaluated in the context of the post in the editor. The other buttons lets you hide one of the panes to give you a larger view of the other pane.

There is a tiny possibility that the environment that the shortcode tester uses to evaluate the shortcode will differ from the environment when the post is normally rendered. The shortcode tester sends a HTTP request for the post in editor to the server. The server processes this request normally until the time to render the HTML. Then a 'template_redirect' action renders the HTML using a special template that only renders the shortcode instead of rendering the entire post. Since, the normal template is not used, the filters and actions in the normal template will not be done. There is a small possibility that these filters and actions could have changed the environment in a way that affects the rendering of the shortcode.
